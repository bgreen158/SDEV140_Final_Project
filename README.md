# SDEV140 Final Project - Airplanes & Missiles!
This repository is for my Final project in my SDEV 140 class. The goal is to create a tkinter based program with GUI elements and more.
I had decided on making a Galaga/Asteroids-like game for this project and had a lot of fun making it!
# Overview

My idea started out as The player would control an object that would move around the screen and shoot other incoming objects coming from the top of the screen. I eventually settled on some kind of aircraft shooting down missiles over the sea or sky.
In the beginning, I originally wanted to make a time limit to survive, but I thought it would be more interesting for the game to progressively get harder the more time went on and would make the player want to try again to beat their high score.

# Controls
In this game, you control a futuristic plane that can shoot lasers to blow missiles out of the sky! When starting the game, you can see the controls on the screen for a few moments.

You can control the plane by using WASD or Arrow keys on your keyboard. For those of you who aren't familiar with WASD controls:

W = up, A = left, S = down, and D = right. 

I have also included the option to control the plane with arrow keys (which control the ship in the direction you think they do) as well if people aren't comfortable with WASD controls.

Furthermore, you can either press the spacebar or left click with your mouse to fire the laser from your plane.

# Dependencies
You will need to install Python on your computer since this requires the files that are included with it. Furthermore, this is a Tkinter based program which also has the requirement of installing python to your computer.

You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Running the game
Once you download the latest release of Python to your computer, just double click the .py file located in the latest full release and enjoy!
